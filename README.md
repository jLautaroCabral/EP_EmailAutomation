# EP_EmailAutomation
###### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning.

Student CRUD desktop application, with mail sending and MySQL database connection.  
The application supports the sending of Gmails but for them, the sender account must be configured to allow access to non-secure apps.  
It also allows to generate a PDF with the data of a selected student thanks to JasperReport.
